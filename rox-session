.xsession: failed to run %s/AppRun - maybe you moved or deleted it?

I'll try to give you an xterm and a filer window instead - try to find
and run ROX-Session to fix the problem. Close the xterm to logout.

If all else fails, delete your .xsession and .xinitrc files to get the
system defaults.

Report any problems to:

Good luck!
